 <h1>What exactly is an API?</h1>
 <p>An API, which stands for 'Application Program Interface', is a set of tools that allow web developers to create applications.  An API is analgous to a library of functions you would use in other programming languages such as C or C++.
 <br>
 
 <h1>What Information Can One Get from the D3 Community API?</h1>
 <p>By using API calls, one can get information about player profiles, player's individual characters, the character's equipment, and about in game characters like blacksmiths and hired help.
 <br>
 <p>Every Diablo 3 player has the same blacksmiths and hired help. People already know about these characters, this how-to guide is going to focus on only the unique information of a player's game. Specifically, the career profile, hero profile, and item data API calls will be addressed.
 <br>
	 
<h1>Where Can One Find these API Calls?</h1>
<p>Go to the Battle.net Developer portal and select the API Docs in the upper left hand corner, then select the D3 Community API-US.  Documentation for what the calls receive and what parameters they need to be called are well documented.
<p>For example, select the Career Profile and it will expand to have strings entered into a form. Enter in any particular battle tag (this is the username of a player). If you do not know any, you can use mukrumbus-1394 as you see below.  Do not worry about the callback entry, we are not going to be working with JSONP during this how to.
