 <h1>What exactly is an API?</h1>
 <p>Like any API, which stands for 'Application Program Interface', is a set of tools that allow web developers to create applications.  An API is analgous to a library of functions you would use in other programming languages such as C or C++.

 <h1>What Information Can One Get from the D3 Community API?</h1>
 <p>By using API calls, one can get information about player profiles, player's individual characters, the character's equipment, and about in game characters like blacksmiths and hired help.
 <br>
 <p>Every Diablo 3 player has the same blacksmiths and hired help. People already know about these characters, this how-to guide is going to focus on only the unique information of a player's game. Specifically, the career profile, hero profile, and item data API calls will be addressed.
