	   <div class="titleBar"><h1>Career Profile Call</h1></div>
	   <p> This page is going to show you how to use the simplest call in the API, the Career Profile Call.
		   <p> Remember at the Blizzard dev portal, when you entered mukrumbus-1394 a request URL was posted underneath
			   <div class="wrapper"><img src="images/d3Explain_1.PNG"/></div>
	   <p>We can break this url, 
	<br><p>https://us.api.battle.net/d3/profile/mukrumbus-1394/?locale=en_US&apikey=7y2eektjvhfu98expct5hwm4w6hvb9r6
	   <br><p>apart to be able to use it for any player.
	   <ol>
	   <li><p>The first part, "https://us.api.battle.net/d3/profile/" is never going to change. We can use this as the beginning of our url and add more strings to it
	   <li><p>The second part,"mukrumbus-1394", is the username. We can use a variable, var Username1, to store the username so that we can find information on different players
	   <li><p>The third part, "locale=en_US", is the region where we can find the player.  We won't be going outside of the US, so we can leave this as a string.
	   <li><p>The fourth part, "&apikey=7y2eektjvhfu98expct5hwm4w6hvb9r6", is just a string and our api key.  We can store the api key as a variable, var apiKey, and use "&apikey=" + apiKey for the end of the url
	   </ol>
	<p>our req.open should look like this with the new url
		<p class="code">req.open('GET', 'https://us.api.battle.net/d3/profile/' + Username1 + '/?locale=en_US&apikey=' + apiKey, true);
