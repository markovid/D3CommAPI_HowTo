 	<p>The D3 Community API will allow us to access information about any diablo 3 player, each of their characters, all of their equipment, and information about in game merchants.
 	<p>Before we go more indepth about how to use the API calls, lets first set up a mashery account with Blizzard entertainment and get an API key in order to access the information.

		<p>After you follow the link, fill out the information.  Be sure to select the Diablo III Franchise for your api key.  Some fields can be left blank without a problem, and the basic plan is sufficient.
